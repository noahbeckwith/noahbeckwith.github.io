<p><i>Note: I gave this talk while live-projecting a copy of</i> Books!<i>, so whenever you read “this book,” that's what I'm referring to. Also, any problems with the writing or project as a whole you might perceive are definitely just due to the way I've reproduced the unedited talk online. Definitely.</i></p>

<p>For clarity, you’re about to hear the word “books” a lot. It has three main uses in this talk. The first is simply the word, “books,” which we’re all familiar with. The second is <i>Books!</i>, the title of my project. The third is also <i>Books!</i>, which is the title of this book. </p>

<p>In late April and early May, I created a collection of fictitious books. I thought up titles, designed and printed the covers, and bound the books using blank paper inside. I then created another book, <i>Books!</i>, that documents and provides information on each book, shows the collection as a whole, and features a short essay I wrote explaining my intentions with the project.</p>

<p>I will gift the books to friends, artists, designers, and other people who are interested in collaborating on the next stage of this project. Some books are intended for specific people, but the majority of participants will choose their books from a web page with a list of the titles and cover images.</p>

<p>The books will then be gifted to this community, with just two conditions: they must “complete” their book, and when they’re done, send me any form of documentation. They can draw, paste in photos, or do whatever they want with the book. Of course, some people won’t fill up their books. People might lose them. Some people might fill their book up according to its title, and others might use it as their sketchbook for an entire year. In a few years, I’ll gather their work together and make yet another book. Participants will have the option to remain anonymous as a way of helping them be more honest when filling up their book.</p>

<p>With <i>Books!</i> I’ve created my dream library. Not in the sense of an idealized fantasy, but a collection of books extracted from my imagination and informed by my knowledge and opinions. The titles range from art and design books to self-help, cookbooks, and young-adult novels. Most of the books are more than one of these things, or other kinds of books entirely.</p>

<p>By leaving them blank inside, and gifting them to friends, artists, designers and other collaborators, I’m speaking to subjectivity and the nature of authorship, as well as ownership. These books contain a potential energy that I want the participants to act on, as all books allow for a similar creative engagement from their readers through note-taking, underlining, doodling, excerpting and countless other forms of interaction.</p>

<p><i>Books!</i>, is where I catalog each of my created books, and present photos of this collection. <i>Books!</i> is the only book I made that isn’t filled with blank pages, so I thought it would be fitting to instead leave the cover entirely blank. The all-white book comes in a clear, printed sleeve with the title, evoking the way in which we project meaning onto our lives. Additionally, this layering of meaning speaks about book-ness, or object-ness. How do we decide what “the object” is? Is the documentation within <i>Books!</i> as “real” as the physical collection? By the time most people are reading this, the physical collection won’t exist anymore—it’ll be dispersed among a community of people and intermingled with their own libraries. Yet the collection will always exist, in memory or concept, and in the form of this book.</p>

<p>The scientific phenomenon of quantum entanglement might be a good way to think about this kind of duality. As we all know, quantum entanglement is when two or more different atoms, separated by distance, become linked. They’re not touching, but their states are entirely dependent on each other, and in a sense they can be thought of as the same atom. A simple analogy to explain this analogy is a coin toss where you have a magic coin and I have a magic coin. These coins don’t behave like ordinary coins. Whenever my coin turns up tails, yours turns up heads and vice versa. If you’re in another room, or another city, or another country, the states of the coins will still be linked, and they are therefore considered entangled. This type of invisible connection operates in our perception of collections– they can be both a group of objects, and an object themselves.</p>

<p>A further analogy comes to mind: trail mix. Let’s say you’ve got pistachios, coconut flakes, cashews, and dried pineapple. It’s nuts, it’s dried fruit, and it’s all trail mix. One of those pistachios is a nut, but it’s also trail mix, it’s also food, it might be a snack, and it could be an allergen. This simultaneous fracturing and assembling of meaning is important to understand, because it can be critically applied to concepts or things we take at face value, or take to be more absolute.</p>

<p>One of my loftier goals for the project is to make people feel the impermanence and fragility of our ideas, mental states, and ultimately, constructions of self.</p>

<p>By allowing people to enter into this dialogue about subjectivity and duality relating to objects (books, libraries, collections, etc.), maybe they’ll apply this same thinking to themselves.</p>

<p><i>Books!</i> is meant to make my reality visible, and let people into this reality through interaction and collaboration. In the same way that I am the link between the books, I’m also the link between the people in the community I’m creating.</p>

<p>Finally, I hope the project presents a convincing idea for what graphic design can be. The designs I have created will ideally capture the attention of designers and non-designers, and be appreciated through a critical analysis comparable to painting or sculpture. Books are traditionally viewed as vessels for the text or form inside, so by removing this normally central element, I hope viewers will notice the type, paper, color, composition, volume and every other quality of a book.
