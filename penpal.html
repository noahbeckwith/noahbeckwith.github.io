                Noah: Hey Sam– It's Noah, your pen-pal. I think we should just decide on the text for a poster, and I'll design it today. I'll go off the idea of a future computer thing, but might change it a bit/make it funnier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Oh sick! Thanks for texting me. Funny is good. Just let me know what you might want it to be bout and I'll send the text your way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Ok here's the idea: Most people amass tons of photos on their phone and computer. My camera roll as 19,825 photos from the last 2 years right now. At this rate, I'll end up with 280,000 by the time I'm 50. What we should propose is a service that cleans out your photos for you, only keeping the important stuff (or something like that).
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: That sounds really cool. What's the format? Advertisement, poster?
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Yeah, an ad poster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Ok cool. So you just want like text about this service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Yeah just try explaining it in like 3-4 shortish sentences and come up with a name for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Corny but... MEMORY.2 THROUGH A 22ND CENTURY ALGORITHM, M.2 WEIGHS YOUR EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO FILES AND SORTS YOUR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ACCORDINGLY, MARRYING YOUR HEART TO YOUR DATA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Perfect. Love it. I'll do a first draft later if I have time. Or tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Awesome! Send me whatever you get done if you can so I can present it Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Sounds good – I'll print a copy for you and have Dylan bring it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Sick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Gonna have Dylan bring this to you:<br>

                Sam: Nice. That looks really cool. The colors are great.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noah: Thanks. It was fun to make. Your copy was really good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam: Thanks. Glad we finished it. Figured we'd come up with something good.
